ErrandRun 🏃‍♂️
A clean, modern task management application built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates core React concepts like component architecture, state management, and browser data persistence.

Dynamic Task Entry: Users can add errands with both a title and a detailed description.
Instant List Management: The interface updates in real-time as tasks are added or deleted.
Persistent Data: Integrated with Browser LocalStorage, ensuring that your errand list is saved even after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
Responsive Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS v4 for a professional, mobile-friendly design that adapts to any screen size.

🛠️ Future Improvements
If I had more time to expand this project, I would focus on:
Task Status: Adding a "Complete" toggle that visually strikes through finished tasks without deleting them.
Edit Capability: Implementing an "Edit" mode to modify existing errand titles or descriptions without needing to delete and re-add them.
Categorization: Adding color-coded tags (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent) to help users organize different types of tasks.
Sorting & Filtering: Adding the ability to sort tasks by date created or search for specific errands by keyword.
Search bar: Add a search bar to find tasks incase the list gets too long.
More style: Add more style to make it more aesthetically pleasing
